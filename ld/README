From Sming RBoot example:

Disabling big flash
-------------------
If you want to use, for example, two 512k roms in the first 1mb block of flash
(old style) then follow these instructions to produce two separately linked
roms. If you are flashing a single rom to multiple 1mb flash blocks (using big
flash) you only need one linked rom that can be used on each.

This assumes you understand the concepts explained in the rBoot readme about
memory mapping and setting linker script address. This is not covered here, just
how to use this sample without bigflash support.

- Copy rom0.ld to rom1.ld.
- Adjust the rom offsets and length as appropriate in each ld file.
- Uncomment 'RBOOT_TWO_ROMS ?= 1' in Makefile-user.mk (or set as an environment
  variable).
- Ensure RBOOT_BIG_FLASH is set to 0 in Makefile-user.mk
- If using a very small flash (e.g. 512k) there may be no room for a spiffs
  fileystem, disable it with DISABLE_SPIFFS = 1
- If you are using spiffs set RBOOT_SPIFFS_0 & RBOOT_SPIFFS_1 to indicate where
  the filesystems are located on the flash. This is the real flash offset, not
  the address + 0x40200000 used in the mount call.
- After building copy all the rom*.bin files to the root of your web server.

If you want more than two roms you must be an advanced user and should be able
to work out what to copy and edit to acheive this!
